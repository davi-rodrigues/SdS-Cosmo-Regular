These codes provide further details on the work "Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime in regular coordinates with cosmological time" by L. Lima & D.C. Rodrigues (2025).

## Files description

`nb` files are Wolfram Mathematica notebooks, while `wl` files are plain text Wolfram Language files. The first requires a license to run. The second can be freely copied and pasted into a Jupyter notebook and can be run using Wolfram Engine as the kernel. 

* `Fig1` and `Fig3` provide the code to generate figures 1 and 3 of the main paper.
*  `SdS Geometric Characterization.nb` explicitly computes geometric quantities using both Kottler and the regular coordinates studied in the main paper. This notebook depends on the FTeV package, which can be promptly installed from [here](https://github.com/davi-rodrigues/FTeV).
